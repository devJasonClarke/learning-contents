**Types Of Blockchain Developer**

As I just specified, there are two types of blockchain developers, namely:

- Core Blockchain Developers

**Core Blockchain Developer**

As discussed earlier, a core blockchain developer is generally involved in the design, architecture, and security of a blockchain system. In brief, their roles include the following:

- Design of blockchain protocols
- Design of consensus protocols and security patterns for the network
- Design of the network architecture
- Supervision of the entire network

- Blockchain Software Developers

### **Blockchain Software Developer**

Blockchain Software Developers have a separate set of roles. These roles have nothing to do with consensus design or architecture of the system. Much like how a normal web developer uses the protocols and design structure set up by a core web architect to build web apps, blockchain software developers build _decentralized applications _or _Dapps _using blockchain technology. Their roles include:

- Development of Smart Contracts
- Development of interactive front-end designs for Dapps
- Backend development pertaining to Blockchain
- Supervision of the entire stack running their Dapps

What languages are needed to code the blockchain?

React.Js,

Solidity,

Truffle Framework,

Ruby,

Node.js,

postgreSQL,

MongoDB,

Redis,

//Objective-C (for iOS),

//and Java (for Android).
